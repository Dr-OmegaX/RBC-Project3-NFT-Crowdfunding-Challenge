## Purpose & Scope:

We have sample surveyed a wide range of feedback over the last few weeks and strongly feel we have observed enough of the metaverse to confidently ascertain the kind of fresh and provocative asset that the NFT marketplace is missing.

Our intent is to launch a crowdfund sale that will allow for fungible token returns to donors willing to contribute their hard earned Ether to the development of a new NFT concept that we know will be groundbreaking - Street Art gone DIGITAL!

We believe the development and mass distribution of this NFT class has the capacity to evoke the kind of political, cultural, intellectual and overall emphatic focus upon the deepest and most intrensic aspects of the human condition; especially as we continously gallop toward and evermore evolving digital age that keeps us too engaged and downright curious to stop pushing forward.

The tokens exchanged to each donor during this crowdfund will be redeemable (after live production is confirmed) for up to a 75% return on each donation!

This will mean our highest teir donors will have, not only the highest priority access to the most impeccable of our digital inventory, but also get first dibs among nearly all first edition releases (giving the potential to purchase 1 or more at as low as 25% of market value! WOW!)
